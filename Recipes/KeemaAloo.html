    <h2>Description :</h2>
    <p>
      This keema aloo curry is by far my favorite Indian recipe. Inspired by my
      mom, who still makes this for me to this day. If you want to try something
      a little different, I guarantee you will love this meal.

    <h2>Steps for making it :</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion;
        cook and stir until soft and beginning to brown, about 12 minutes. If
        browned bits of onion are stuck to the bottom of the pan, add water and
        stir to loosen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir ground beef, garlic, ginger, serrano chile, and cilantro into the
        pan; cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 10 to 15 minutes.
        Reduce heat to medium-low. Stir in coriander, salt, cumin, cayenne
        pepper, and turmeric; cook and stir until flavors blend, about 5
        minutes. Add potatoes and tomatoes; cover and simmer until potatoes are
        tender, about 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in green peas and cook until sauce has slightly thickened and
        flavors have blended, 10 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle garam masala over top,
        cover, and let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
